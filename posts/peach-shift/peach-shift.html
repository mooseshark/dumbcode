            So, curiousity has gotten the best of you? You want to know what a bitwise exclusive or opertator is?
            Maybe you already know and are thinking, "This isn't how you use that"? Perhaps you just want to see how dumb this can be.
            Please, allow me to take you on a magical jounrey of pointlessness.
          </p>

          <div class="h4"><strong>What even is this?</strong></div>

          <p>
            This is a demonstration of how to use the bitwise exclusive or opertator to convert one string to another and the process that goes into doing so.
          </p>

          <div class="h4"><strong>Why would you ever do that?</strong></div>

            Really, you wouldn't. There's basically no scenario where this would ever be useful or convenient. <strong>But</strong>, that doesn't mean it can't be interesting.
            This is a neat way to see how the bitwise exclusive or (XOR) operator works. This will allow us to take 2 strings, break them down to decimal values, break them down again to
            binary values, then use a few extra steps to rebuild our initial string to the string we wish to convert it to.
          </p>

          <div class="h4"><strong>I don't know? That sounds pretty stupid.</strong></div>

          <p>
            It is pretty stupid, but there's some smart XOR operator stuff shuffled around in all the stupid. So, first, What's a bitwise exclusive or operator?
            It's purpose is to take two binary values and compares them. The return of this comparison results in a <strong>1</strong> anywhere the two binary
            values do not match, and a <strong>0</strong> where they do. The XOR operator is signified by a caret (^) in the majority of programming languages, if not all of them.
          </p>

          <div class="h4"><strong>Alright, how about an example?</strong></div>

          <p>
            Alright, let's break this down. We'll start with 2 characters <strong>p</strong> and <strong>s</strong>. <strong>p</strong> is represented by the binary value <strong>1110000</strong>.
            <strong>s</strong> is represented by the binary value <strong>1110011</strong>. So when we use the bitwise XOR operator, we are writing it as
            <strong>p ^ s</strong>, however, the computer will see this is <strong>1110000 ^ 1110011</strong>. The computer will then compare these 2 binary numbers to see which
            bits are the same, and which ones are different. In this case, <strong>11100</strong> are all the same. This will produce five 0 bits. The last two bits of <strong>p</strong>
            and <strong>s</strong> are differnt. This will produce two 1 bits. That makes the final return of <strong>1110000 ^ 1110011</strong> equals <strong>0000011</strong> or simply
            <strong>11</strong>. Unforetunately, <strong>11</strong> is difficult to represent as an ASCII character as it stands for "End of Text". ASCII conversion aside, this still makes for a
            decent example as to how bitwise XOR functions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tight! Let's waste some time converting strings with XOR. We've got some of the building blocks in the table above, but it doesn't really paint the entire picture.
            For the purpose of this, we're going to take two strings I've chosen: <strong>peach</strong> and <strong>shift</strong>. Why these two? I like Princess Peach, we're shifting
            some bits around, they both have 5 characters. Sky's the limit here.
          </p>

          <p>
            As stated before, the XOR operator does a comparison of two binary values and returns true (1) or false (0) depending on if the bits in those two values are different or the same.
            We have to do a little bit of hoop jumping to take a string, break it down to binary values for each individual character, then rebuild those binary values as our intended result.
            We'll start with our strings, <strong>peach</strong> and <strong>shift</strong>. Both strings have to be broken down to individual characters. The way I've done this is using a
            <strong>for in</strong> loop and a counter. But there's lots of other, likely better ways to do this. You could use the string <strong>.split()</strong> function or a normal <strong>for</strong>
            loop to go over each character. It's really up to you as long as we have access to the individual characters of our two strings.
          </p>

          <div class="text-center">
            <pre><code class="javascript hljs">
  let stringOne = "peach";
  let stringTwo = "shift";
  let counter = 0;
  let stringTwoLen = stringTwo.length - 1;

  for (let s in stringOne){

    //counter is reset to 0 when the length of stringOne
    //exceeds the length of stringTwo, forcing the
    //conversion to start over from the beginning for the
    //remaining characters in stringOne
    counter === stringTwoLen ? counter = 0 : counter++;
  }
          </code></pre>
        </div>

          <p>
            Now that we have both strings seperated out we can start our bitwise XOR operation the characters right? That's a big negative. Well, at least in JavaScript that's a big negative.
            To perform a bitwise XOR operation on a string, we need to conver the string character to a decimal value. A decimal value is a numerical representation for an ASCII character. In
            our case, <strong>p</strong> will become <strong>112</strong>, and <strong>s</strong> will become <strong>115</strong>. We can find the decimal value of a character in JavaScript using
            the <strong>.charCodeAt(index)</strong> function, where <strong>index</strong> is the location of our character in the string. Since we've broken down our strings into single characters,
            our index will always be <strong>0</strong>.
          </p>

          <div class="text-center">
            <pre><code class="javascript hljs">
  for (let s in stringOne){
    //for our "peach shift" example, we'll base this on the first
    //characters of peach and shift.
    //stringOne[s] = p
    let stringOneDecimal = stringOne[s].charCodeAt(0); //112
    //stringTwo[counter] = s
    let stringTwoDecimal = stringTwo[counter].charCodeAt(0); //115

    counter === stringTwoLen ? counter = 0 : counter++;
  }
            </code></pre>
          </div>

          <p>
            Cool. We've reached our first XOR operation. Similar to the above example, we'll now take the decimal values, do a bitwise XOR comparison on them and receive a result. Sticking with
            <strong>p</strong> and <strong>s</strong>, we ended up with an operation that looks like <strong>112 ^ 115</strong>. And like before, this breaks down further to
            <strong>1110000 ^ 1110011</strong>, leaving us with a final result of <strong>11</strong>.
          </p>

          <div class="text-center">
            <pre><code class="javascript hljs">
    let stringOneDecimal = stringOne[s].charCodeAt(0); //112
    let stringTwoDecimal = stringTwo[counter].charCodeAt(0); //115

    //We get our conversion decimal value for coverting
    //stringOne to stringTwo with XOR
    //No need to covert to binary as XOR will do this
    //with the decimal values
    let firstXORDecimal = stringOneDecimal ^ stringTwoDecimal; //3

            We've just gotten started with how overly complicated this gets. Now we need to take the first character of our initial string and do a secondary bitwise XOR operation with the result of
            our first bitwise XOR operation. That's right, we're doubling down! We start with the decimal value of <strong>p</strong> from <strong>peach</strong>which is <strong>112</strong>. Next
            We take our result from our first XOR operation <strong>11</strong>, execpt <strong>11</strong> is the binary value the computer sees from comparing the bits between the two decimal values.
            What we will see is the decimal value rpresented by <strong>11</strong>, which is <strong>3</strong>. As stated before, <strong>11</strong> or in this case <strong>3</strong> is the
            ASCII representation for "End of Text" which isn't really easy to show as an ASCII character. Now that we have these two decimal values, we do our bitwise XOR operation <strong>112 ^ 3</strong>.
            Naturally, the computer breaks this down to a binary operation of <strong>1110000 ^ 0000011</strong> which results in <strong>1110011</strong>. And you know what that converts to?
          </p>

          <div class="text-center">
            <pre><code class="javascript hljs">
    let stringOneDecimal = stringOne[s].charCodeAt(0); //112
    let stringTwoDecimal = stringTwo[counter].charCodeAt(0); //115
    let firstXORDecimal = stringOneDecimal ^ stringTwoDecimal; //3

    //Now we redo the operation to get back to the decimal
    //value from stringTwo, or the string we wish to convert to
    let secondXORDecimal = stringOneDecimal ^ firstXORDecimal; //115
            </code></pre>
          </div>

          <p>
            THAT'S RIGHT! We're back at decimal value <strong>115</strong>. In JavaScript, we can use <strong>String.fromCharCode(115)</strong> back to the ASCII character represented by <strong>115</strong>
            and of course we get <strong>s</strong>. And through a needlessly complicated and incredibly stupid method, we've converted one character from one string to another character of another string.
            Now that the character has been converted we can append it to a new strong, or the way I did it, push the character to an array. We then repeate the process for each character in each string.
            The end result is either a full strong, or an array container the characters of the converted string. With the array method, we can then use <strong>ourArray.join("")</strong> to recombine all
            of the characters back to a single string. Our end result being the string <strong>shift</strong>.
          </p>

          <div class="text-center">
            <pre><code class="javascript hljs">
    //String.fromCharCode() allows us to convert the decimal back
    //to an ASCII character
    let convertedCharacter = String.fromCharCode(secondXORDecimal); //s

          <p>
            Not so fast now. I did a little bit of research, just to make sure I wasn't missing something here. It turns out this exact method can be used as some sort of low level
            encryption. That's something I 100% didn't know when I wrote it. I thought I just found a really useless complicated thing I could do with a bitwise operator. Essentially
            you take two strings, your message to encrypt, and a key word for unencrypting the message. Just as we've done here, the message is encrypted by taking the key and using
            the bitwise XOR operator to change the original message into a garbled mess. When you give the encrypted message to someone, they use the key given to them to decypt the
            message. Basically converting a string to another string. Pretty neat really.
          </p>

          <div class="h4"><strong>So that wasn't really a complete waste of my life?</strong></div>

          <p>
            I guess not, but honestly, this method of encryption is pretty weak. This article basically covered everything needed to uncover the message. If you could decrypt a few words
            or a sentance of the message, you'd probably be able to start taking a guess at what the decryption key was. It appears this method can be repeated though, and the more iterations
            of encrypting a message, the harder it will be to decrypt.
          </p>

          <div class="h4"><strong>What do I do now?</strong></div>

          <p>
            Here's a functioning model of what we've discussed in the article. It may be handy for visualizing the entire process and see exactly how you might work out converting one
            string to another with this method. I've also included an example function that you can play around with on your own. Maybe you can change things, or modifiy it and make your
            own mini-encryption app or something. It never hurts to have some fun and play around, just to see what you can make.
